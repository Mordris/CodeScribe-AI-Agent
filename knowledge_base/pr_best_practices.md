# Pull Request Best Practices

## PR Titles

- All Pull Request titles must follow the Conventional Commits specification.
- Example: `feat(api): Add user authentication endpoint`
- Example: `fix(worker): Correctly handle job retries`

## PR Descriptions

- The PR description must never be empty.
- It should include a "Why" section explaining the purpose of the change and a "How" section describing the implementation approach.
